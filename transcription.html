<head><h2><u>Basics of Transcription</u></h2></head>

<p><h3>Transcription is has many meanings, and is a word used in many fields. For our purposes, transcription is the process of taking a word in English and rewriting it in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and vice versa.</h3></p><br>

<p><h3>So, for example, take the word "flute". When it's transcribed into IPA, it looks like this: /flut/. <br><br>

Here, there isn't much difference between English and IPA. This isn't always the case. Take the work "shrink", which looks like /ʃrIŋk/ when transcribed. You need to be careful. Spelling isn't always your friend.<br><br>

</h3></p>

<ul><h3>Some tips<br><br>

    <li>English loves silent letters. So just because a word has six letters, that doesn't mean that the IPA transciption will. Take the word "knight". In IPA, it's /naIt/.</li><br><br>

    <li>English also uses combinations of letters to represent a single sound, like "sh", "th", and "tch".</li><br><br>

    <li>In English spelling, letters can be pronounced different ways. Take the letter "x". It can be pronounced three different ways.<br><br>
   
   
        <ol><blockquote>
            <li>When "x" starts a word, "x" is usually pronounced  /z/, like in Xylophone: /zaIləfoƱn/. </li><br><br>

            <li>When "x" is surrounded by voiced sounds, it represents two voiced sounds. /gz/, like in "exit": /ɛgzIt/.</li><br><br>

            <li>Everywhere else, "x" represents two voiceless sounds: /ks/, like in tax: /tæks/.</li><br><br>

</blockquote>
    </ol>
    </li>

<li>"Qu" is another good example. This consonant cluster has two different pronounciations: <br><br>
    
    <ol>
        <blockquote>
            <li>It's usually pronounced /kw/, as in quick: /kwIk/</li><br><br>

            <li>Sometimes, it's pronounced /k/, as in pique: /pik/</li>



        </blockquote>
    </ol></li>

<li>Some words have multiple pronunciations. <br><br>

    <ol><blockquote>
        <li>Sometimes, the different pronunciations don't change the meaning of the word, like "either". In IPA, it's /iðɚ/ or /aIðɚ/.</li><br><br>

        <li>Sometimes, the meaning does change, as in "record". <br><br>
        
        When the stress is on the first syllable, it's /rɛkɚd/. This is the noun. When it falls on the second syllable, it's pronounced /rIkɔɚd/ and it's a verb. <br><br>
    
        English loves doing this. We have many words that do this. </li>
