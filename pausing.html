    <h2><p>Why discuss pausing?</p><br><br>

    <p>It's a valid question. We all pause when we speak, after all. We pause to let other people speak. We pause to emphasize a point. Most basically, we pause so that we can breathe. The problems come in when we pause in a place where we didn't mean to. So here are a few rules. These rules come in handy when your giving a presentation or working from a script.</p></h3><br><br>
</h2>
    <h2><ul>Three Basic Rules for Pausing<br><br>

        Actually, if you really look into this, you'll find many rules, but we're going to focus on three.<br><br>
        
       <li>Pause at punctuation.<br><br>
    
    Punctuation is the text telling you to breathe. This includes all punctuation: periods, commas, colons, semi-colons, etc.</li><br><br>
        
        
        <li>Pause before conjunctions.<br>

            <p>Conjunctions link things together. So, you pause at the conjunction to say "That was part one. Here comes the next part."</p>

        </li><br>

        <li>Pause every seven words or so.<br>

           <p> This one is a little more complicated. We have to pause in longer phrases to allow our audience to keep up. Also, we need to breathe.<br><br>

            Just because this rule says seven words, that doesn't mean you need to pause every seven words. It can be fewer words.<br><br>
            
            Frequently, we pause to emphasize something. As a result, you can use pausing to focus attention where you want it.</p>
