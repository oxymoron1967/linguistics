<ul><h2><u>Vocabulary Defined</u><br></h2>
<h3>


<li><p id = "voicing"></p>Voicing

    <blockquote>Voicing is the vibration of the vocal chords.<br><br>
    If you put your fingers on your throat and make the /z/ sound, you'll feel those vibrations.<br><br>
    
    Sounds that have this vibration are called voiced. <br><br>

    Now, put your fingers on your throat and make the /s/ sound. You shouldn't feel any vibrations.<br><br>

    Sounds that don't have this vibration are called voiceless. </blockquote>

</li>

<li><p id = "place"></p>Place of Articulation: This describes where the sound is made. 

    <ul> <blockquote>

<li>Lips -- Sounds made here are called <b>labial</b>.</li>
<li>Teeth -- Sounds made here are called <b>dental</b>.</li>
<li>Alveolar Ridge -- The Alveolar Ridge is located right behind the teeth, between the teeth and the palate. Sounds that use the Alveolar Ridge are called <b>alveolar</b> sounds.</li>
<li>Palate -- This is the hard part of the roof of the mouth. Sounds made here are called <b>palatal</b>.</li>
<li>Velum -- This is soft part of the roof of the mouth. It is sometimes called the soft palate. Sounds made here are called <b>velar</b></li>
<li>Glottis -- This is the part of the throat where the vocal chords are. Sounds made here are called <b>glottal</b>.</li>

<blockquote>Note that we combine these words, or add prefixes to them, so that when we describe the places of articulation, they go like this: 
    <ul><li>Bilabial, which means both lips are used. English has three: /b,p,m/</li><br>
    <li>Labio-dental, which means that the lower lip curls up to touch the teeth. English has two: /v,f/ </li><br>
    <li>Interdental, which means the tongue is between the teeth. These sounds are also called linguadentals. English has two: /θ,ð/ <br></li>
    <li>Alveolar, which means the tongue touches the alveolar ridge. English has six /d,t,z,s,n,l/<br></li>
    <li>Palatal, which means the tongue touches the palate. English has six /ʃ,ʒ,ʧ,ʤ,r,j/.<br></li>
    <li>Velar, which means the tongue is oulled back in the mouthm touching the velum. English has three: /k,g,ŋ/<br></li>
    <li>Glottal, which means the airflow is constricted at the glottis. English jas one: /h/<br></li>
    <li>Labio-velar, which means the tongue is pulled back in the mouth while the lips are rounded. English has one: /w/.<br></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


    </blockquote>

    </ul>
</li>

<li><p id = "manner"></p>Manner of Articulation

<blockquote>Manner of articulation is how the sound is made, and they are defined by how the flow of air is restricted. The manners of ariculation are: <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Stop: Here, the airflow stops. Put your hand in front of your face and make a /p/ sound. Do you feel how all air stops? That's why it's a stop. You'll also see these sounds called plosives, becuase of blast (explosion) of air that comes after the airflow stop. Rnglish has six stops: /p,b,t,d,k,g/.<br><br></li>

<li>Fricative: Here, the airflow is restricted to a thin stream. Put your hand in front of your face and make an /s/ sound. Do you feel that constant stream of air? That's what makes it a fricative. English has nine: /f,v,θ,ð,s,z,ʃ,ʒ,h/<br><br> </li>


<li>Affricate: Here, the sound starts like a stop, but ends like a fricative. Think of it as two sounds smashed together. English has two: /ʧ,ʤ/<br><br></li>


<li>Nasal: Here, the air comes out the nose. Put your hand in front of your face and make an /m/. Do you feel the air coming out of your nose? You should. English has three nasal sounds: /m,n,ŋ/<br><br></li>


<li>Glide: Here, the airflow is not restricted (like in fricatives). Think of it as the tongue gliding by another part of the mouth but not really touching it. English has two /w,j/.<br><br>

These sounds, along with the retroflex and lateral (see below) are sometimes grouped together as approximants.<br><br></li>


<li>Retroflex: Here, the tip of the tongue curls backwards while the sound is made. So flex for stretching, and retro for backwards. We have one retroflex in English, /r/. <br><br>

As noted above, /r/ is also classified as an approximant.<br><br>

/r/ varies across dialects of English, so while this is considered the standard, you will here other versions of the sound.<br><br></li>


<li>Lateral: Here, the sides of the tongue are used to make the sound. English has one lateral: /l/.<br><br>

As noted above, /l/ is also classified as an approximant.<br><br></li>

</ul></blockquote>

</li>



<li><p id = "describe"></p>Describing consonants. Consonants are described using voicing, place of articulation, and manner of articulation.<br><br>

So, a /z/ would be a voiced, alveolar fricative and a /k/ would be a voiceless, velar stop.</li>
