Articles are sometimes classified with other parts of speech. See the complications entry below.

<li><p id = "basic"></p><h3>Complications

    <br><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Compound words 

            <br><br>

            English loves to make new words by joining words together. Sometimes, these can complicate matters:

            <br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Compound Nouns

                <br><br>

                Usually, compound nouns are written as one word, such as "airport" or "wheelchair", or they're attached with a hyphen, like "e-mail". Sometimes, though, compound nouns are still written as separate words, like White House or United States. So, even though White House looks like an adjective and a noun, in terms of word stress, rhythm, and intonation, it's considered one unit. 

                <br><br>

                Look at these sentences: 

                <br><br>

                <ol>
                     <li>Dave toured the White House when he visited D.C.</li>
                     <br><br>
                     <li>The white house on the corner burned down last week.</li>
                    <br><br>

                </ol>

                There is a slight but noticeable difference in pronounciation of "White House" in the first sentence and "white house" in the second.

            </li>

            
            <br><br>

            <li>Compound verbs</li>

</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>

        <li>Determiners</li>

        <br><br>

        <li>Words that move from category to category</li>

        <br><br>

        <li>Words no one agrees on</li>



    </ul>

    <br><br>


</h3></li>


    </ul>
