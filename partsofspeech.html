<br><br>

<li><p id = "arts"></p><h3>Articles
    
    <br><br>

Articles modify nouns. English has three: the definite article "the", and the indefinite articles "a" and "an".

<br><br>

Articles are sometimes classified with other parts of speech. See the complications entry below.

<br><br>

<li><p id = "conj"></p><h3>Conjunctions
    <br><br>

    Conjunctions join words or phrases together. Examples include "and", "although", and "if".

<br><br>

<li><p id = "prep"></p><h3>Prepositions

    <br><br>

    Prepositions are small words that usually describe where, when, why or how something takes place. They are usually followed by a noun phrase. These are called prepositional phrases. Examples include "to", "at", and "in".

<br><br>

<li><p id = "pro"></p><h3>Pronouns

    <br><br>

    Pronouns are small words that replace nouns that have previously been referred to. There are several categories of pronouns including:

<br><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Personal pronouns. Examples include "I", "you", and "they"</li>
        <li>Possessive pronouns. Examples include "your", "his", and "her"</li>
        <li>Demonstrative pronouns. Examples include "this", "that", "these", and "those".</li>
        <li>Question words. Well, sometimes, see complications below. Examples inclide "who", "what", and "when".</li>

    </ul>

</h3>

</li>

<li><p id = "basic"></p><h3>Complications

    <br><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Compound words 

            <br><br>

            English loves to make new words by joining words together. Sometimes, these can complicate matters:

            <br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Compound Nouns

                <br><br>

                Usually, compound nouns are written as one word, such as "airport" or "wheelchair", or they're attached with a hyphen, like "e-mail". Sometimes, though, compound nouns are still written as separate words, like White House or United States. So, even though White House looks like an adjective and a noun, in terms of word stress, rhythm, and intonation, it's considered one unit. 

                <br><br>

                Look at these sentences: 

                <br><br>

                <ol>
                     <li>Dave toured the White House when he visited D.C.</li>
                     <br><br>
                     <li>The white house on the corner burned down last week.</li>
                    <br><br>

                </ol>

                There is a slight but noticeable difference in pronunciation of "White House" in the first sentence and "white house" in the second.

            </li>


            <br><br>

            <li>Compound verbs

                <br><br>

                English likes to pair verbs with prepositions. Prepositions usually are followed by noun phrases, but in this format they don't always. Look at these sentences:

                <br><br>

                <ol>

                <li>I woke up early this morning.</li>

                <li>Money is a little tight right now, but I'm getting by.</li>

                </ol>

                <br><br>

                Note that neither "up" nor "by" have a noun phrase following them. 




            </li>

</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>

        <li>*sigh* Articles are messy.

            <br><br>

            <ol>

                <li>Sometimes, the word "some" is added to the articles as a plural indefinite article.</li>

                <br><br>

                <li>Usually, they are listed in their own separate category.</li>

                <br><br>

                <li>Sometimes, articles are lumped in with adjectives, because they do modify nouns and noun phrases.</li>

                <br><br>

                <li>Sometimes, they are thrown into a category called determiners, which includes articles, demonstrative pronouns, questions words, and possessive pronouns. These words frequently show deixis.</li>

                <br><br>

            </ol>


        </li>

        <br><br>

        <li>Words that move from category to category

            <br><br>
<ul>
            <li>Depending on context, many words can change categoies. Sometimes, the pronunciation of the word changes, such as the following:

            <br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>"Record": When the stress is on the first syllable, it's a noun; when it's on the second syllable, it's a verb. English has many words like this.</li>

                <br><br>

                <li>"Invalid": When the stress is on the first syllable, it's a noun; when it's on the second syllable, it's an adjective.</li>

                <br><br>

            </ul>
            </li>

            <li> But, frequently, pronunciation isn't much of a help.

                <br><br>

            <ul>

                <li>"Who" is either a question word, as in "Who just came in?", but when it's not asking a question, it's a conjunction, as in "Mike is the man who was fired."</li>

                <br><br>

                <li>"So" is either an adverb, as in "The blizzard was so brutally cold", or it's a conjunction, as in "Alan finished work quickly so he could start his vacation early."</li>


            </ul>    
            </li>

            <br><br>

            <li>Auxiliary verbs

                <br><br>

                <ul>

                    <li>Usually, this is a straighforward construction, like this: "I should finish my homework."</li>

                    <br><br>

                    <li>However, you can stack auxiliary verbs, so you get phrases like this: "Dan might have been going to the movies".</li>

                    <br><br>

                    <li>Also, some verbs can be auxiliary verbs in some constructions but be the main verbs in others. Look at the foloowing sentences:

                        <br><br>

                        <ol>

                            <li>I have already fixed the problem.</li>
                            <br><br>
                            <li>I have the book with me.</li>

                        </ol>

                        <br><br>

                        In the first sentence, "have" is an auxiliary verb. In the second sentence, it is a main verb.

                    </li>






                </ul>
                </li>




            <li>And then we have the word "that".

                <br><br>

                <ul>

                <li>"That" can be a conjunction, as in "Ann saw that the restaurant was closed" or a demonstrative pronoun as in "Could you hand me that book?".</li>

                <br><br>

                <li>This leads to constructions like this (From the Gettysburg Address): "We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives <u>that that</u> nation might live.
                
                    <br><br>

                    It might feel wrong to have those two "that"s next to one another, but it is absolutely correct. 
                
                </li>    

                </ul>
 

        <br><br>
